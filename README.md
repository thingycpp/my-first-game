# my-first-game
A quick game I am making with raylib, please make fun of my code, I need all the help I can get!

Raylib is a C library that makes making games pretty easy! You can find info on their website: https://www.raylib.com/

If anyone who stumbles apon this just so happens to be good at pixel art please help me out here, I kinda suck.
