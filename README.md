# Green Dude

This is a quick game I am making with raylib, please tell me anything you think I should know in terms of coding, I am some what of a begginer since I started december of 2020 and I need all the help I can get!

Raylib is a C library that makes making games pretty easy! You can find info on their website: https://www.raylib.com/

If anyone who stumbles apon this just so happens to be good at pixel art please help me 
out here.

If you are willing to help in any way shape or form please message me on discord: Darrell#3307.
